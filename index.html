        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <P>DANCE YOUR HEART OUT was recently founded in 2023 by Hannah Trisha Mercado. The co-founders have seen how SoulCycle made spinning a new popular form of exercise, and the studio has now become a lifestyle brand. They envisioned to make dance the next big sporting and fitness category. DANCE YOUR HEART OUT focuses on various urban dance styles such as house, popping, hiphop, whacking, breaking, dancehall, trump, and heels.</P>
